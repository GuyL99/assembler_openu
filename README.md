# assembler_openu
final project for cs computer systems

## things left to do:
#### 1. fix issues:
		a)pre.c-stop,rts->fix current method and create new
		b)pre.c-problem with reading the first line as comment and empty lines after it
		c)second.c-core dump-probably in case 2 - fixed index
#### 2. integrate object conversion - dor this is yours to write
#### 3. create an output writing mechanism to the .ext and .ent
#### 4. create a data writing mechanism and append it to the end of the stack


### think of more if you have any
